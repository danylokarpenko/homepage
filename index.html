                    I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can join if you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a
                    casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another Trump!</p>
